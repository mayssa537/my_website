Introductory code:

```{r, setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  message = FALSE, 
  warning = FALSE, 
  tidy=FALSE,     # display code as typed
  size="small")   # slightly smaller font for code
options(digits = 3)

# Trump's Approval Margins

Loading data:

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Import approval polls data

setwd("C:/Users/mayss/Documents/LBS_Term1/Data Analytics for Finance/my_website/content/projects/project3")

approval_polllist <- read_csv(file='data/approval_polllist.csv')

# or directly off fivethirtyeight website
# approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

glimpse(approval_polllist)

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.
```

## Create a plot

We calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office:

```{r}
approval_polllist %>% 
  mutate(
    week = week(as.Date(enddate, format="%d/%m/%Y"))
  ) %>% 
  summarise(
    week = week,
    N = n(),
    std_dev = sd(approve, na.rm=F),
    net_approval_rate = mean(approve) - mean(disapprove)) %>% 
  summarise(
    week = week,
    net_approval_rate = net_approval_rate,
    N = N,
    std_dev = std_dev,
    upper_ci = mean(net_approval_rate) + 1.96*(std_dev/sqrt(N)),
    lower_ci = mean(net_approval_rate) - 1.96*(std_dev/sqrt(N))
  )

Trump_approval<-approval_polllist%>%
  mutate(date=as.Date(approval_polllist$enddate, format="%m/%d/%Y"),
       week=week(date),
       year=year(date),
       net_approval=approve-disapprove) %>% 
  group_by(week,year)%>%
  summarise(mean=mean(net_approval),
            stdev=sd(net_approval),
            count=n(),
            se=stdev/sqrt(count),
            t_critical=qt(0.975,count-1),
            lower_bound=mean-t_critical*se,
            upper_bound=mean+t_critical*se)

Trump_approval %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=week, y=mean)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line()+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=lower_bound, ymax=upper_bound), linetype=2, alpha=0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~year) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color ="orange") +
  xlab("Week of the year") +
  ylab("Average net approval (%)") +
  labs(title="Estimating Net Approval (approve-disapprove) for Donald Trump",
       subtitle="Weekly average of polls")

```

You can facet by year, and add an orange line at zero. Your plot should look like this:

```{r trump_margins, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}


knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/mayss/Documents/LBS_Term1/Data Analytics for Finance/my_website/content/projects/project3/images/trump_approval_margin.png")
```

## Compare Confidence Intervals

Compare the confidence intervals for `week 15` (6-12 April 2020) and `week 34` (17-23 August 2020). 

```{r}
Trump_approval %>% 
  filter(
    year ==2020,
    week %in% c(15, 34))
```

Coronavirus affected voters approval rating of Donald Trump, as we enter week 34 with still little action on the containment of the virus voters became more uncertain and less voters supported them
