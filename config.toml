  description = "Originally from Los Angeles, California, I am currently pursuing a Masters degree in Financial Analysis at London Business School. Despite the stereotype that accompanies my studies, I find myself to be a 'people person.' I thrive in group work, although I do usually prefer to work independently. As for my interests, I have experience in quite a range areas, from special needs education, beauty pageants, journalism, travel, and dance. While all are rather unrelated, they've encouraged me to keep an open mind and to take every opportunity to learn. In addition, they've all contributed tremendously to my abilities, such as practicing patience, managing my time, adapting quickly, and remaining organised. "
